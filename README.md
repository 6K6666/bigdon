# bigdon
Project made during spare time to post lots of emojis at once to make the artwork known as "big don". Visit our Discord server to get all of the emojis needed to complete big don: https://discord.gg/3MyzvxZ7Mh

should also be obvious that nitro is needed to use this btw, and if you're interested in making your own project like this one I used https://ruyili.ca/image-splitter/ to split up the big image into smaller emoji sized images
